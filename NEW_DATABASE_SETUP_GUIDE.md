## 🧪 Verification Steps

The script automatically verifies:

### Profile Verification
- Counts auth users vs database profiles
- Ensures every authenticated user has a profile
- Reports any mismatches

### Policy Verification  
- Counts RLS policies for each table
- Ensures all CRUD operations are covered
- Tests policy functionality

### Storage Verification
- Confirms marketplace-images bucket exists
- Verifies storage policies are active
- Tests upload permissions

### Data Verification
- Confirms sample categories are available
- Checks category count and structure
- Validates data integrity

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Script Execution Fails

**Check Prerequisites:**
- Ensure you have admin access to Supabase project
- Verify you're running script in SQL Editor
- Make sure no other scripts are running simultaneously

**Common Issues:**
```sql
-- If you get "extension does not exist" errors:
-- The script handles this automatically with IF NOT EXISTS

-- If you get "permission denied" errors:
-- Make sure you're project owner or have sufficient permissions

-- If profiles aren't created:
-- Check that auth.users table has users with valid email addresses
```

### Manual Verification Queries

```sql
-- Check table creation
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- Check profile coverage
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users WHERE deleted_at IS NULL) as auth_users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.users) as profiles;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename LIKE '%marketplace%' OR tablename = 'users'
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;

-- Check storage bucket
SELECT id, name, public FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id = 'marketplace-images';

-- Check categories
SELECT name, icon, color FROM marketplace_categories 
ORDER BY sort_order;
```

## 🚀 Next Steps After Database Recreation

1. **Test Your Application**
   - Run through complete user registration flow
   - Test marketplace item creation with images
   - Verify all features work as expected

2. **Update Application Code** (if needed)
   - Ensure your app queries match new table structure
   - Update any hardcoded references to old schema
   - Test all marketplace functions

3. **Deploy and Monitor**
   - Deploy your application updates
   - Monitor for any remaining authentication issues
   - Check error logs for any missed edge cases

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues with the new database setup:

1. **Check the verification output** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Review table structure** - Ensure all tables were created properly  
3. **Test incrementally** - Test registration, login, and marketplace separately
